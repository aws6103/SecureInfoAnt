			<h1>Passing the CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 with no experience!</h1>
			<time datetime="06-29-2020">June 29, 2020 </time>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Back in 2017, I found myself shunned by recruiters and job applications as I didn't have much to showcase my expericence or expertise within security. As a junior I was fairly new to the field, with only a few entry level courses at my university about of the topic under my belt. I want to really elevate my skill set and to show my interest within information security. I recall having spoken to a particular recuriter who recommeneded that I go after a certification, in particluar EC's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), the Cisco Certified Network Associate Security (CCNA Security), or the CompTIA Security+. Upon further research I made the goal to go after my first certification in early 2018, and had decided to go after the CompTIA Security+. After 4 months of study I was able to pass the exam!

  
<br>
<br>CompTIA recommends that test takers have knowledge that encompasses the conent earned from the CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications and up to 2 years of work experience with a focus in seurity. As I knew I was fairly weak with all sorts of concepts around information technology in general I knew that it was going to be a very diifuclt task but benefial for me to do.  
<br>
<br> Security+ is considred by CompTIA to be one of it's core certiciates and forms the CompTIA trifecta alongside Network+, and A+. The certificates places a large focus on various concepts within iunfomration security, such as being able to recognize vulnerabilitites, knowing how to maintain a secure environment, to pariticpating in the risk managemtn strategies. The six domains covered in the SY0-501 exam are: 

<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
	<li> Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilties</li>
	<li> Technologies and Tools</li>
	<li> Architecture and Design</li>
	<li> Identity and Access Management</li>
	<li> Risk Management</li>
	<li> Cryptography and PKI</li>
</ol>
	 





			<h2> Exam Resources I Used</h2>
			

			<h3> CompTIA Security++ Exam Objectives File</h3>
<p>
After reading up on some advice from reddit, I found this document to be of the most importance pieces into prepaing for this exam. In what would be a crucial piece for preparing for later CompTIA certification exams, this document is benefical in organizing and showcasing the scope of the exam. Everything is divided it's respective domain which helps organize notes and to plan how to study. Everything that is listed on this document will be in some shape or form a focus in the exam. This document is a must for anyone looking to take the exam. 
<br>
<a href="https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/Security%2B%20SY0-501%20Exam%20Objectives.pdf" class="links"> The link the CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 exam objectives can be found here. </a> 

			<h3>Professor Messerâ€™s CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Course</h3>
<p>
Professor Messer's course is without a doubt one of the best cost effective sources to learn the content for the exam as his entire 13 hour and  45 minute course is free. I found the course to be great, as Professor Messer divides his videos into their respective domnains based on the exam objectives with many of them containing a transcript to take  notes of. The course material can  be purchased to download but I never really found myself doing so as I found his videos to be sufficient enough.

<h3> CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide 4th Edition </h3>
<p> 
	
The  <em> CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide 4th Edition </em> by Darril Gibson is a brilliant book to accompany Professor Messer's videos. The book offers a large amount of content and helps to explain concepts for weaker individuals. The use of sections labled "Remember This" help suummarize the recently disucssed material and how they can be utilized in an actual scenario. Also  after each chapter their is a review section up to 15 questions which are helpful for preparing how exam questions would be structured.

<h3> CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 Prep App </h3>
<p> 
	
This app offers a large amount of questions and practice exams compiled by Darril Gibson to better preapare one for the exam. I found it best to not worry about the scores I would recieve but why I had gotten some problems wrong and what would be an acceptable answer. The app is a gret too to understand how problems on the exam are worded which is a crucial part in preparing for any CompTIA exam. 
<br>

<h3> Certblaster's perfomance based video </h3>
<p>
I can't really comment on the quality of Certblaster which offers it's very own course to help prepare for the Security+ exam. I recall I had watched this one video to get an understanding of how the performance based questions were as that confused me during my preparation. But after watching this video, I felt it wasn't going to be the hardest thing in the world, which for anyone feeling stressed over the exam would see this as a helpful resource.

<h2> Exam Experience</h2>
<p>
As this was my first certification exam I didn't know what to expect. I thought I could do it but had accepted beforehand that it was also likely I would fail. But I had to give it a shot, and as with everything, you'll never know until you try.
<br> My exam consisted of 3 performance based questions (pbqs) and 65 multiple choice questions. The pbqs were very easy but I saw my lack of experience hurt me during  the multiple choice section of the exam. I decided to flag a number of problems and leave them for the end of exam. A common thought I found amongst many entry-level test takers was the thought that they would fail mid-exam and that's what I felt as well. It was to my shock that in the end that I saw that I had passed!
<br>
<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
Two years after taking the exam I can still see the accelerated growth in knowledge within the realm of information security due to the CompTIA Security+. I recall being such a limited beginner that I was only familiar witrh the CIA triad and the concept of DDOS attacks and being able to progress to the point to discuss the intricacies behind various symmetric/asymetric encyrption algorithims. A baseline of knowledge was established which I feeel grateful for. I felt happy that I was able to pass and the certificate, even one that is listed as a <a href="https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/" class="links"> DoD Approved Baseline Certification. </a> Though after two years of taking of the exam I can also understand the various criticisms surrounding the Security+ exam, from comparisons to the CEH, to it largely being a multiple choice exam for entry level individuals, and that the exam covers a large amount of content for it not to go too much in depth. But for anyone looking to transition into security or take up a challenge for themselves this is a certificate I recommend.
