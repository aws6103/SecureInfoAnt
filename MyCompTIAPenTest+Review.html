			<h1>My CompTIA PenTest+ review!</h1>
			<time datetime="06-22-2020">June 22, 2020 </time>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
After 2 months of preparation, I passed the CompTIA PenTest+ exam earlier this month. This is my 4th certification, my 3rd from CompTIA and I am proud for what I had been able to accomplish. With this review I felt this would be a great way to reflect on the past few months on how I was able to prepare while perhaps being a useful resource for potiental test takers. 
<br>
<br>CompTIA recommends that test takers have knowledge that encompasses the conent earned from the CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications or a miniumum of 3-4 years of work experience. With only a few months of relevenant cyber security work experience as well as degree and the Security+ and CySA+ certifications under my belt I felt this would be an attainable but difficult certificate that would improve my skillset and knowledge that I have. 
<br>
<br> PenTest+ is considered by CompTIA to be an intermediate level certificate, above the core Security+ certificate with a specialization towards Red-Team with CySA+ as it's opposite for Blue-Team.  The certificate places a large focus on being able to conduct penetration tests for organizations from planning and scoping, to vulnerability identification, expolitation, and the proper communication of results. Test takers are expected to be able to know of the various tools to conduct open source intelligence such as WHOIS or traceroute, to being able to set up a variety of different scans within NMAP, and being able to differentiate between certain tools and their use cases. The test taker should be able to understand vulnerabilties and how it is possible to exploit them through injections, MITM, ect. After accomplishing their exploits, the test taker shlould be able to know how to address the vulnerabilties and how to communicate that to the contracting organization. 





			<h2> Exam Resources I Used</h2>
			

			<h3> CompTIA PenTest+ Exam Objectives File</h3>
<p>
After having taken and passed both the CompTIA Security+ and CyberSecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification exams, I already had some understanding of how to prepare and what to expect for CompTIA exams. What I always found to be useful was the the pdf file provided by CompTIA of their exam objectives. A great strategy of mine is to learn each and every single bullet and acronym listed in each pdf file. A study tip of mine is to be able to discuss each point, and concept listed in the file in order to better grasp the material. What is also beneficial is that CompTIA already divides the exam objectives into their respective domains making it easier to organize notes and focus on strengths and weakness for the exam.  This document is a must for anyone looking to take the exam.

			<h3>Jason Dion's Udemy CompTIA Pentest+ (Ethical Hacking) Course & Practice Exam</h3>
<p>
When I had taken the CompTIA CyberSecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification I had used Jason Dion's course to help learn the content for 					the exam. Given my positive experience I had similar expectations for Jason's PenTest+ 8 hour course. The videos are divided based on the respective domain for the exam which I found convinent. I enjoyed the content that was provided as well as the demonstrations Jason showed on what certain tools and outputs should look like. Jason throughout the course also encourages the user to seek out practice on their own to better master the concepts and tools for the exam. At the end of the course, the user is provided with a 70 question practice exam which can also be a useful resource for studying. When it came to the final review for the actual exam I found the content from his course was rather lacking. The course does a good job in covering large parts of the exam objectives but was rather missing some explanations or details for some topics that would be helpful for individuals. The course is shown at the time of this writing to be $94.99 but there are often times when the course is offered at large discounts or at a reduced price with a coupon code coming to around $12-$15. My recommendation is that the course is okay, but it's great if you have suplamental resources to further your studies.

			<h3> CompTIA PenTest+ Study Guide: Exam PT0-001</h3>
			<p> 
	
The  <em> CompTIA PenTest+ Study Guide: Exam PT0-001 </em> by Mike Chapple and David Seidle is a phenominal book that covers much of the exam content in a readble format in only 503 pages. At the end of each chapter is a short review exam with each being 20 multiple choice questions long. The book does not go in the same order of the domains and some chapters do tend to have some overlap when it comes to covering certain domains. I found myself reading this book with my notes in hand after completing Jason Dion's course and filling in any missing gaps within each domain that I thought to be important. The book would be great for those with limited techical knowledge but have an understanding of several security concepts.

<h3> CompTIA PenTest+ Practice Tests: Exam PT0-001 </h3>
<p> 
	
The  <em> CompTIA PenTest+ Practice Tests: Exam PT0-001 </em> provided by Sybex is a brilliant book to accompany the previously mentioned CompTIA PenTest+ study guide. The book does an effective job in preparing readers with the type of questions they can expect while taking the exam as well as offering an explanation for each 	question. What I also liked were the various questions with topics and tools that weren't listed in the exam objectives but did encourage me to research those to better prepare myself. I do have a few complaints as the questions and answers do tend to get a bit repetitive and the various typos can make it difficult when it comes to review. An example that comes to mind is a question that requires two answers and the explanation guide only offers the correct rationale for one of the 	answers instead of both. Such errors can raise a few eyebrows but I will still say this book is a must to anyone looking to take the exam.

<h3> TryHackMe </h3>
<p>
TryHackMe is an online platform that allows you to participate in hands on activities with tools that are relevant to the exam. It operates in a similiar format such as HackTheBox but TryHackMe holds your hand throughout the process through the inclusion of hints. The platform is very beginner friendly and provides you with a variety of rooms to learn and gain a foothold before you try the more harder ones. The room had come in handy when learning how to utilize tools like NMAP, and hydra that were necessary for the exam. TryHackMe is free to use but there is also a $10 monthly subscription you can pay. If you choose to set up a premium account, TryHackMe provides you with deployable VMs through the cloud and more premium rooms such as a learning path for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). I would recommend however is to set up your own virtual machine to connect to the platform that you can easily clone or take snapshots so you will be able to run your own experiments and labs.

<h2> Exam Experience</h2>
<p>
CompTIA had recently decided to allow remote testing as an alternative to onsite-testing. I decided to take advantage of this which provided a new experience to taking a CompTIA exam as my previous certification examps were always at certain location. All that were required was a valid government ID, a clean test area void of any study materials, and a computer with a working webcam and mic. I was allowed to connect to PearsonVue 15 minutes before my exam appointment. 
<br>
My exam consisted of 5 performance based questions (pbqs) and 65 multiple choice questions. The pbqs had really threw me off and I could see that my lack of experience was going to hurt me a bit. I decided to flag them for review and leave them for the end of the exam. The multiple choice was easy, but required a thorough reading as to not let one slip up. I was still abe to answer them confidently. I returned to the pbqs onced I finished and spent over around an hour reviewing each one to make sure they were performed correctly. Despite this I felt as though I was going to fail and I wasn't confident in the result. PenTest+ felt much harder than the previous CompTIA exams I had taken. Upon finishing the exam I was relieved to find that I had passed! It was a great feeling and made me feel relieved after all the hard work I put in. 
<br>
<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
The desire to earn certificates is always a great idea as they present an opportunity to learn more content and estabshlish a standard for the knowledge one can recieve.  From my own opinion, after having taken the exam, I can see the value in knowledge I was able to learn from the use of tools and methods to attack along with a host of other important concepts. I can see how an individual would be able to use this to help transition towards a career in penetration testing. I feel as I can take these concepts and apply them towards preparation for the much more reputable and demanding OSCP. It was also a bonus to extend the duration of my Security+ and CySA+ certificates up to 2024. For those looking to learn something new and want to challenge themselves I would recommend this certificate. However not every certification is made the same, and due to costs, and reputation it is a bit difficult to find other reasons to pursue the PenTest+ certification. CompTIA already struggles within the industry of having primarily multiple choice exams without realy challenging the test taker. Having been released in July, 2018 the PenTest+ certification is still too new to be considered reputable or well known within the industry. Though as more individuals take and pass the exam it will only become a matter of time before the PenTest+ becomes recognized as a valuable certifcate.
