			<h1>Interview Question: What Port does Ping use?</h1>
			<time datetime="07-31-2020">July 31, 2020 </time>
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
			I came up with this idea after the past few years of going through different interviews and finding I have recieved similiar type of questions. I thought I start with ones that were simple but can throw one off if they don't come prepared.
			For this piece we'll go through a few questions and see what the answers to those are. But in an interview knowing the answer to a question is one thing, but being able to phrase it properly in the moment is an art.
			To begin we'll start with the question:
			<br>
			<br>
				<strong>Describe a situation where you had a problem with a team member and how you overcame it?</strong>
				<br>
				Behavioral questions are often difficult to answer as the interviewer desires to hear a more personal experience from you. For this type of question they want to see how well you work with others to determine whether you maybe a good fit within a team.
				Teamwork is an essential part of any job and being able to work through problems to ensure a job or assignment is done is what's looked at here. For this type of question you will want to describe the issue like a teammate not pulling their weight
				or the approach for solving a problem and the steps you took to resolve it. From there you can describe how solving this conflict helped complete the task that was at hand. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>What port does ping use?</strong>
			<br>
			Now this question can throw the intervee off if they're not familiar with the tool ping. Ping can be easily used through the Windows command line or Linux terminal with the command <strong>ping</strong>
			followed by the target's IP address. Ping will look to check to see if a particular host is reachable across the network. It does this by sending ICMP (Internt Control Message Protocol) packets to the target host which is where the answer to this question is found.
			ICMP is a layer 3 protocol and thus has no ports associated with it like TCP/UDP has. Thus we find that ping does not use a port.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>What is the TCP-3 Way Handshake?</strong>
			<br>
			This a very simple question and it can be easy to remeber but it's important to have to know the basics so we aren't caught off guard. It is a three step process. It begins with my machine sending a SYN flag to the target host.
			The second step has the target host respond with a SYN-ACK flag. The last step involves our machine replying with an ACK flag ensuring a connection is established.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>What is XSS?</strong>
			<br>
			This a difficult question as the term XSS refers to cross site scripting. It is an attack in which an input field such as comment boxes, and login forms are subject to injection from the client normally through JavaScript.
			There are many different types of cross site scripting but we won't go into that. It is important to know how to prevent XSS such as through proper techniques by escaping, and sanitzing user input.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>What security blogs do you follow?</strong>
			<br>
			An important aspect of information security is being able to keep up with newly occuring threats and how you maintain a good knowledge base. There are a number of useful public security blogs and resources that are liked such as 
			Krebs on Security, Security Weekly, Wired, and Threat Post. Another good source can be the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report. It is important to keep up with your own list of resources and have a wide variety in mind.
