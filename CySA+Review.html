			<h1>Blue-Team and the CompTIA CySA+!</h1>
			<time datetime="06-20-2020">June 20, 2020 </time>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In 2018 I had taken and passed the CompTIA CySA+, also known as the Cybersecurity Analyst+ exam after only two months of study. I still held on to all my notes and resources and after reviewing all this information I learned I wanted to reflect on what the exam prepares test takers for. 
CompTIA recommends that test takers have knowledge that encompasses the conent earned from the CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications or a miniumum of 3-4 years of work experience. As of the current moment the CompTIA CS0-001 version of the exam I had taken would be retired this October, 2020. As of April 21, the CS0-002 version has been made available. As a disclaimer it does not matter which version of the exam you take as passing either version grants you the certificate. It is best to keep the sources you gather for the exam aligning with the version you plan to take. This review would be for the CS0-001 as much of the sources I used were designed for this version of the exam but would still point out some of the differences between the two versions.
<br>
<br> CySA+ is considered by CompTIA to be an intermediate level certificate, above the core Security+ certificate with a specialization towards Blue-Team  The certificate places a large focus on being able to handle threats and conduct incident response to mitigate risk. The four domains for the CS0-001 exam are:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
	<li> Threat Management</li>
	<li> Vulnerability Management</li>
	<li> Cyber Incident Response</li>
	<li> Security Architecture and Tool Sets </li>
</ol>
<p>
<br>
<br>
The CS0-002 is split into five domains and those are :

<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
	<li> Threat and Vulnerability Management</li>
	<li> Software and Systems Security</li>
	<li> Security Operations and Monitoring</li>
	<li> Incident Response</li>
	<li> Compliance and Assessment</li>
</ol>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Test takers are expected to be able to know how operate  defensive tools to be able manage risks and threats that an organization would be able to face. There is a large emohasis on being able to perform log reviews as well as interpreting vulnerability scans to find anything out of the ordinary. The test taker should be able to know how to address vulnerabilities with appropriate responses, as well knowing of the various safeguards in place in in case of an incident. This exam teaches the individuals abilities to apply their skills into blue-team side of security. 



			<h2> Exam Resources I Used</h2>
			

			<h3> CompTIA CySA+ Exam Objectives File</h3>
<p>
The best and most important resource to prepare for any CompTIA exam is to use the respective pdf file provided by them detailing the objectives for the exam. It is a useful tool in remembering what a test taker is able to expect for the exam and to also organize their notes based on the domain. A great strategy is to be able to discuss every single bullet and acronym in the file to better understand each concept.

			<h3>Jason Dion's Udemy CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-001) Complete Course and Practice Exam</h3>
<p>
Jason Dion 10 hour course covers pretty much everything that will be covered on the exam. I felt after reviewing my notes his course covered every single concept for the exam. Jason also offers slides to study off of which I felt it was best to take notes of each slide and to watch his lectures afterwrads for him to further expand on he material. This course is another must to help know everything on the exam. At the time of this  writing the course is listed as $94.99 but there are often times when the course is offered at large discounts or at a reduced price with a coupon code coming to around $12-$15.

			<h3> CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide: Exam CS0-001</h3>
			<p> 
	
The  <em> CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide: Exam CS0-001 </em> by Mike Chapple and David Seidle is a phenominal book that covers much of the exam content in similar fashion that Jason Dion's Udemy course had. At the end of each chapter is a short review exam. Throughout the book are various lab exercizes that allow you to familiarize yourselve with the various concepts and toolsets covered by the exam. The book also provides access to Sybex's online learning environment which has access to 2 practice exams which are useful in prepaing for the type of questions of what to expect for the exam. This book is an essential tool to help prepare for the exam.

<h3> Optional: CompTIA Security+</h3>
<p> 
When I had taken the CySA+ exam I was several months removed from having taken the Security+ exam. Despite the CySA+ covering so many topics that were new to me, I found there was also quite an overlap from some of the content discussed. This allowed me to focus entirely on new material while also strengthening what I previously learned before. It makes it very easy to transition from the Security+ to the CySA+.


			</p>

<h2> Exam Experience</h2>
<p>
<br>
My exam consisted of 3 performance based questions (pbqs) and 70 multiple choice questions.  As opposed to when I had taken the Security+ I remember I wasn't stuck with the pbqs and was able to answer those quickly. This allowed me to transition to the multiple choice questions which I found to be a okay. Some were easy and some were challenging, with a few having come down to 50-50 decision. But in the end I had finished the exam with over an hour to spare and was happy to see that I had passed.
<br>
<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
One idea I often notice is the increase in popularity in wanting to learn ethical hacking or to be apart of red team. In the realm of the security this is just one side of the coin with the other being known as blue-team (We can't also forget about the valuable purple-team). It was nice to be able to learn through the pursuit of the certificate of concepts focused soley on defending. The CySA+ has also gained more attention, enough to be listed in the <a href="https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/" class="links">DoD Approved Baseline certifications</a>. While CompTIA certificates are described as being a mile wide and two inches deep in terms of material the CySA+ can prove to be valuable beginner-intermediate level for those looking to transition to blue-team.
